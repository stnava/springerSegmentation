overview of what is required

## ABSTRACT

In one or two paragraphs, please write an overview of the method described.

## INTRODUCTION

This section should contain a summary of, and the outline of any theory to, the method that you’re are describing. It should also outline the major procedures involved in the protocol.

## MATERIALS

Describe the images and software here

## METHODS

This is the main section and should explain in detail the individual steps necessary to carry out the technique. Where possible, please simply list the steps in numerical order. For techniques that comprise a number of separate major procedures, please indicate these separate procedures in the introduction, and then subdivide section 3 into subheadings to cover each procedure. The steps in each subsection should then be numbered individually, renumbering 2 from number one. Do take great care to try to indicate any little “tricks” or nuances that help improve your method by referring to relevant “notes” in section 4 (see below). This sort of information rarely gets into the scienti c literature. You may also nd it useful to relate to some aspects of the theory in this section indicating the purpose of some of the major steps by crossreferencing to an appropriate “note”. Do not be tempted to get involved in the description of variations/alternatives to your technique in this section: this can be done in the “Notes” section. Stick to the basic procedure detailed in this section. This section must be comprehensive. Do not send the reader away to nd information for a particular step in another reference. All relevant practical detail must be given in this section.


## NOTES

As we all know, even the simplest techniques go wrong from time to time. Would you therefore indicate any major problems or faults that can occur with your technique? Try to indicate the major sources of problems and how they can be identi ed and overcome. With reference to related techniques, any variations of the technique that you have described should also be made in this section, as well as–where relevant–an indication of the sensitivity of the method, timescale for the singled technique, etc. This “Notes” section is a hallmark of this series and has been singled out for praise by a number of reviewers. Please try and make this section as extensive as possible by putting on paper all of your various experiences with the technique. Each ‘Note’ should be cross-referenced with the ‘Materials’ and ‘Methods’ sections, e.g. (see Note 1).  Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter.

## references

Arabic numbers should be used for text citations (set within parentheses at point of citation), and they should be listed in numerical order in text, as well as in the reference section. Please be as comprehensive as possible with the references.
