# Introduction {#intro}

This section should contain a summary of, and the outline of any theory to, the method that youâ€™re are describing. It should also outline the major procedures involved in the protocol.

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab}
knitr::kable(head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', booktabs = TRUE)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].



Segmentation is critical to image quantification.  In the context of brain mapping, the question of where (localization) is as important as quantity.  

image classification

importance of challenges 

imagine the future: cloud-based databases of labeled data that let us ID patterns in medical images

public resources - what tools are needed for this scenario?

* tissue based on intensity 

* learning from training 

* identify networks


---- like online quality assessment etc to allow rescanning etc

---- longitudinal stability wrt hardware / software upgrades

---- how validate gradient-induced distortion correction?

---- performance relative to other methods - esp on older subjects
